# Analyzing King County Real Estate

-Chris, Tim, 'Timi

## Overview


We have been contracted by a building company, Flatiron Construction Co., newly located in King County, WA. They want to enter the housing market and are unsure of which features of a new house are most important when looking to build and sell. We have been asked to source relevant data and provide the needed information.
