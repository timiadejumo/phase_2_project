# Analyzing King County Real Estate

-Chris, Tim, 'Timi

## Overview


We have been contracted by a building company, Flatiron Construction Co., newly located in King County, WA. They want to enter the housing market and are unsure of which features of a new house are most important when looking to build and sell. We have been asked to source relevant data and provide the needed information.

### **Business Understanding**
At the onset, there are a lot of decisions a home builder must make. A home builder's dream is to make homes that tick all of the boxes on the buyer's checklist. However, the question a builder wants answered is exactly what the buyer wants in a home. Our client, Flatiron Construction Co. has given us the opportunity to answer that question as they foray into King County.

### **Data Understanding and Analysis**
We sourced our data majorly off the King County Housing sales dataset, which is widely and openly available on the Internet. We were also able to source some additional data from the 
Capitol Impact Government Gateway website. The dataset is for house sales in King County, WA between the the years 2014 to 2015. The dataset is available in .csv
format. 
To analyse the data, we made use of the following Python libraries:
-Numpy v1.20.3
-Pandas 1.1.3
-Matplotlib 3.3.1
-Statsmodel 0.12.0
-Scipy 1.5.2, and 
-Seaborn 0.11.0

The following information pertaining to home sales is available readily on the datasets: 
-date and price of sale of the home
-location of the property (zipcode and longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates)
-size (in square ft) of each property
-age
-condition
-number of bathrooms and bedrooms
